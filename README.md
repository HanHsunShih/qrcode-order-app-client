### Live Demo 🏄🏻‍♀️
Check out the live demo: [QR Code Order Application](https://seaward-migration-plan.netlify.app/)


This QR code order application is designed for my sister, who runs a cafe in Taiwan, allowing customers to place orders online. The menu reflects what she actually uses in her cafe.

I built the client side to display the menu and handle the entire ordering process. Additionally, there is an admin dashboard that requires login access, enabling authorized users to view customer orders and order history.
